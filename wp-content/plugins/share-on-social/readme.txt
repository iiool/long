Drive new users to your site and increase engagement through interactive shares.

== Description ==

Share on Social allows you to lock a part of content of WordPress Post or Page until user shares your blogs in social media. Plugin posts the shared link as interactive posts to user's wall and  helps you to drive new visitors and increase engagement.

* Interactive Posts. Share on Social plugin shares the blog as Interactive Posts in Facebook, which displays the link to your blog prominently on user's Wall.
* Share any link. By default, plugin shares blog URL, but you are free to attach blog's parent, site or even external URL to share buttons.
* Unlimited lockers. Create unlimited number of lockers and customize each differently.
* Multiple lockers. Allows you to place multiple lockers on a page or post.
* Group the lockers. This advanced feature allows you to group a set of lockers from a blog or even from multiple blogs. Grouped lockers lock and unlock in unison.
* Customizable locker banner. Visual Editor allows you to style your own banner for the locker.
* Remembers users who already unlocked your content (via cookies).
* Locks any type of content: text, videos, images, links, forms and more.
* SEO friendly. Search bots (Google, Bing, etc) can crawl locked content.
* Statistics. Track shares by date and social media. You can also view total shares since plugin activation.
* Lite on WordPress. Plugin doesn't create custom tables in Wordpress database. This leaves your installation neat and clean.
* Compatible with all the popular browsers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why twitter button opens locker without tweet =
In Oct 2015, Twitter made changes to [JavaScript Events like Tweet, Follow](https://twittercommunity.com/t/forthcoming-change-to-web-intent-events/54718).  Now Events are triggered when a user invokes the action rather than after the action is completed. Because of the change, Twitter generates the event as soon as user clicks tweeter button which open the locker without waiting for the tweet action by the user. In other words, it is not possible to use twitter with locker anymore. So, by default, Twitter is disabled in Basic Locker.

= Why twitter button is smaller than Facebook icon =
Unlike Facebook, Twitter share API doesn't allow us to change the icon.
